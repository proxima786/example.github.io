            <p>Hi there! I’m Jebraan Mudholkar, a Master’s student at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München</a> (yes, it's in Germany, and yes, the name is unnecessarily long). My research interests revolve around exoplanet habitability, their atmospheres, stellar astrophysics, and pretending to understand Fourier transforms in interferometry.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Sharjah, UAE, a beautiful city that somehow remains unknown to some people. So, to avoid long explanations, I just say "Dubai"—it sounds fancier, and let’s be honest, it makes me feel richer. Due to this, my friends lovingly (or not) call me NRI (Not Really Indian), which is totally accurate but also completely wrong. After spending 18 years there, I moved to Pune for my Bachelor's degree (shoutout to Fergusson College). Then, I somehow found myself in Munich, Germany, where I now attempt to survive cold winters, complicated equations, and the number of types of bread Germans seem to have.</p>
            <p>My love for astronomy started when I watched a National Geographic video on exoplanets and their potential to host life. It blew my mind—suddenly, my life mission became proving the existence of aliens (spoiler: I haven't succeeded yet). In high school, my dream was to find life beyond Earth using physics and math—yes, I was THAT kid. Then reality hit during my Bachelor's, and I realized that even if I became a scientist, I’d still probably have to personally fly to Proxima b to confirm anything. So, I slightly adjusted my expectations, but my passion for exoplanets still burns bright.</p>
            <p>If you’re curious about my super-serious academic life, you can check out my LinkedIn (but be warned, it’s mostly me trying to sound professional).</p>
            <p>Apart from my nerdy life, I am a gym enthusiast, a cat lover, and a somewhat good cricket player (I do support India). If you have hung around for this long - thanks for reading.</p>
