        <h2>Analysing the Dichotomy of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) by Means of Their Luminosity Functions</h2>
        <p>This study aims to collect two population statistics of galaxies in the early universe (Lyman-Break Luminosity functions and the UV Luminosity functions). Our objective is to better understand the dichotomy between the galaxy populations that are contributing to these two selection effects. This dichotomy is crucial for improved galaxy sample selection guided by different observational methods. In particular, we understand and refine the methodology developed in the literature for establishing the connection between the two luminosity functions.</p>

        <h2>Photometry and Spectroscopic Studies of Exoplanet Hosting Stars of Potentially Habitable Planets</h2>
        <p>With the advent of high-resolution astrospectroscopy coupled with medium to large aperture telescopes around the globe, the spectroscopy of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise data is crucial to the exoplanetary community. The data can be used to derive the chemical composition and atmospheric characterization of stars. In this study, we aim to develop models in Python which enhance this understanding by correlating the chemical profile of stellar photospheres and their known exoplanets.</p>

        <h2>Study of Potentially Habitable Planets</h2>
        <p>This study investigates potential trends in exoplanet habitability by utilizing data from NASAâ€™s Exoplanet Archive, specifically exoplanets from the Kepler mission. An algorithm was developed in Python for the purpose of employing scaling and visualizing this dataset. The focus of the analysis was the dimensions and environmental dependencies against the dynamic criteria of the habitable zone, providing insight into potential correlations and patterns in exoplanetary systems.</p>
